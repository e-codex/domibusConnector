Subject to Licensee's compliance with the following terms and conditions, Licensor grants to Licensee a license under the terms set forth below.

Article 1  Definitions.   For the purpose of this License Agreement, the following terms have the following meanings:

(1)  “Application” is any work that makes use of the Program in connection with another software program.

(2)   “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Program or a Modified Program. The particular version of the Program or Modified Program with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked Version”.
(3)   “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the system libraries  and script interpreter libraries when the Program includes scripts, of the Combined Work.
(4)   "Licensee" means any individuals or legal entities that have agreed to and accepted terms and conditions of this License Agreement.
 
(5)  "Licensor" means Original Author of the Program and any individuals or legal entities that have the right to distribute, transmit or license the Program subject to terms and conditions of this License Agreement.
 
(6)  "Modified Program" means computer programs and documents created by translating, modifying, or otherwise adapting the Program in accordance with Article 3.
 
(7)  "Object Code" means certain types of Program or Modified Program that are machine-readable and related documents attached to such programs, except in those instances where the Program is coded using a script language where the source code and object code are the same. 

(8)   "Original Author" mean FUJITSU AMERICA, Inc., that possesses copyrights of the Program's original programs and related documents.
 
(9)   "Patents" mean any and all of patent rights, utility model rights and design rights.
 
(10)   “Program" means the whole or a part of software created by the Original Author and referenced on the attachment to this License Agreement.

(11)   "Source Code" means certain types of Program or Modified Program that are human-readable and related documents attached to such programs.

Article 2  Formation of this License Agreement.   This License Agreement shall be formed and become effective if and when Licensee uses, copies, stores, or reproduces the Program at which time such Licensee shall be deemed to have agreed and accepted to be bound by terms and conditions of this License Agreement.
 
Article 3  Grant of License.   Licensor hereby grants to Licensee, a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, copy, reproduce, translate, modify, distribute, and transmit the Object Code and Source Code versions of the Program, and sublicense such license to any third party in accordance with this License Agreement.

Article 4  Distribution.   Licensee shall comply with the following conditions in the event that Licensee distributes or transmits the Source Code or Object Code of the Program or Modified Program to any third party:

(i)  Licensee shall reproduce all of the terms and conditions of this License Agreement and attach such terms and conditions to the Program or Modified Program in order to have such third party comply with the terms and conditions of this License Agreement. In such case, for avoidance of doubt, Licensee as defined under this License Agreement shall be read as Licensor under those reproduced terms and conditions, and in the event that such Licensee licenses the Modified Program, such Modified Program as defined under this License Agreement shall be read as the Program as defined under the reproduced terms and conditions. Licensee shall additionally advise any sublicensee that this is an open source license and that it is issued in connection with the standards produced by the OASIS standards organization. 

(ii)  Licensee shall attach to the Program or the Modified Program all of the notices of Patents, trademark rights, and copyrights, as well as the Original Author’s notice provided in the Attachment of this License Agreement, without deleting or changing such notices.
 
(iii)  Licensee shall attach to the Modified Program its own appropriate notice of copyrights in accordance with "Sample of Copyright Notice" provided in the Attachment of this License Agreement in addition to the notices provided under the foregoing Item (ii).
 
(iv)  Licensee shall be responsible and defend and indemnify Licensor as regards any use or sublicensing of the Programs or Modified Program which is not in strict compliance with this License Agreement.   

(v) When distributing or publishing the Modified Program, Licensee shall license such work as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License Agreement. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works themselves, then this License Agreement and its terms do not apply to those sections when distributed as separate works. However,  when the same sections are distributed as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License Agreement, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
(vi) If Licensee modifies a copy of the Program, and in such modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility, then Licensee may convey a copy of the Modified Program under this License Agreement, provided that Licensee makes a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. 
(vii) The object code form of an Application may incorporate portions of the Program or instructions that invoke the Program. In such cases Licensee may convey such object code under terms of Licensee’s  choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), Licensee gives prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Program has been utilized  and its use are covered by this License, and accompanies the object code with a copy of this License Agreement. 
 (viii)  Licensee may distribute a Combined Work under the Licensee’s  terms provided that  such terms  effectively do not restrict in any manner the modification and distribution of the portions of the Program contained in the Combined Work and further provided that Licensee: 
a) Gives prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Program is used in it and that the Program and uses of the Program, as distinguished from the Combined Work as a whole, are covered by this License Agreement;  
b) Accompanies the Combined Work with a copy of this License Agreement; 
c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Program among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of this License ; and  
d)  Conveys the Source Code of the Program under the terms of this License Agreement, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work. 
  

Article 5  No Transfer of Rights.   Licensee hereby acknowledges that this License Agreement is not effective to transfer or convey to the Licensee or any other person Licensor’s Patents, trademark rights and copyrights or other intellectual property rights with respect to the Program or the Modified Program.
 
Article 6  Intellectual Property.  Licensor hereby grants to Licensee a world-wide royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use and sublicense Licensor's Patents but only to the extent contained in the Program and only to the extent necessary for Licensee to use and sublicense the Program or the Modified Program in accordance with the terms and conditions of this License Agreement.  
 
6.1  In the event Licensee enforces its own Patents related to the Program or the Modified Program against the Original Author or against any individuals or legal entities who comply with the terms and conditions of this License Agreement in using, copying, reproducing or sublicensing the Program or the Modified Program, the licenses granted under this License Agreement shall become void at the time of such notice of enforcement;  this License Agreement shall be immediately terminated without further action on the part of the Licensor;  and Licensee shall cease using, copying, reproducing, modifying, distributing, or transmitting the Program or Modified Program or exercising any other rights thereafter.

6.2  Licensee understands that although Licensor has granted the licenses set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Licensor that the Program or Modified Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other person. The Licensor hereby disclaims any liability to Licensee for claims brought by any other person based on or related to the infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, the Licensee hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Licensee to distribute the Program, it is Licensee's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
 
Article 7  Trademarks.   This License Agreement is not a license or grant of any other permission express or implied to the use of Licensor's trademarks with respect to the Program or the Modified Program.

 Article 11  Liability.   IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFIT, LOSS OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OR OTHER DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, INJURY, OR INFRINGEMENT OF PRIVACY OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS HOWSOEVER CAUSED AND BASED ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INCAPABLITY TO USE THE PROGRAM OR THE MODIFIED PROGRAM, OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT EVEN IF ADVISED OF POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Article 12  Termination.   In the event that Licensee breaches of any terms and conditions of this License Agreement, Licensor may immediately terminate this License Agreement, cause such Licensee to stop using, copying, reproducing, modifying or transmitting the Program or the Modified Program, or otherwise exercise any rights hereunder and claim any damages incurred by such breach or termination against such Licensee; provided, however, that any third party to whom such Licensee has granted a license to distribute, transmit, or use the Program or the Modified Program in accordance with Articles 3 and 4 may continue to distribute, transmit, or use such Program or Modified Program subject to the terms and conditions of this  License Agreement.
