Changes in Release 1.3.1 of the ECodexConnector Framework:

-- in ECodexConnectorCommon the PartnerEnum was extended with further participants.
-- in ECodexConnectorCommon connection pooling for database connections introduced. This is a performance issue.
-- in ECodexConnectorGatewayWebserviceClient the payload for the message to the gateway was extended by CONTENT_PDF. This is for participants that do not use the
   SecurityToolkit and therefore not generate and ASIC-S container.
