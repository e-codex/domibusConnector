Changes in Release 1.3.1 of the ECodexConnector Framework:

-- in ECodexConnectorCommon the PartnerEnum was extended with further participants.
-- in ECodexConnectorCommon connection pooling for database connections introduced. This is a performance issue.
-- in ECodexConnectorGatewayWebserviceClient the payload for the message to the gateway was extended by CONTENT_PDF. This is for participants that do not use the
   SecurityToolkit and therefore not generate and ASIC-S container.
-- in ECodexConnectorController the logging was improved.
-- in ECodexConnectorController the possibility to turn off the check of unconfirmed messages for evidences was implemented. Additional parameter in connector.properties introduced.
-- in ECodexConnectorController the check for evidences timeout was extended by the possibility to have a timeout 0. In that case this timeout is ignored.
