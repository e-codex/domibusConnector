Changes in Release 1.1 of the ECodexConnector Framework:

-- in ECodexConnectorGatewayWebserviceClient the matching between PayloadInfo in the ebms header and the payloads themselves were extended.
    Now also the actual size of the payload has to match the size given in the property of the payloadInfo header.
-- in ECodexConnectorCommon the name of the persistence unit is now explicitly set in the DAOs so a national implementation maybe can use
   another persistence unit if required.
