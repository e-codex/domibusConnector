Changes in Release 1.1 of the ECodexConnector Framework:

-- in ECodexConnectorGatewayWebserviceClient the matching between PayloadInfo in the ebms header and the payloads themselves were extended.
    Now the payload itself is transported as an XML structure containing some relevant meta data of the payload.
-- in ECodexConnectorGatewayWebserviceClient the sending of a dummy AgreementRef in the ebms Header is re-integrated, as the holodeck, when
   no AgreementRef is sent, does not send the pmode information to the receiver as well.
-- in ECodexConnectorCommon the name of the persistence unit is now explicitly set in the DAOs so a national implementation maybe can use
   another persistence unit if required.
