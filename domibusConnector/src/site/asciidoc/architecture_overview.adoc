= Architectural Overview

== Overall ECodex Architecture

The domibusConnector (connector) is placed behind the Gateway (https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/e-SENS+AS4+conformant+solutions[Possibly GW Solutions] - usually the Domibus GW is used).
The connector connects the GW (Gateway) with the national implementation. The national implementation can be
a whole and complex system or just a single application.

(Reference Setup)

The connectorSuite consists mainly 3 components:

* ConnectorClient
* Connector itself
* Domibus Gateway Connector Plugin

=== ConnectorClient / ConnectorClientLib / National System

Connector Client is the bridge between the national system or application and the connector. It is
 responsibly for mapping (if necessary) the international message to the national message. 

The connector client can call the service interface on the connector directly or can use the
provided ConnectorClientLib. 

For further information read the connectorClient documentation.

=== Domibus Gateway Connector Plugin

The Gateway Plugin is installed as plugin at the Domibus Gateway and communicates with the connector
over a webservice. 

=== Connector

The connector itself handles the transformation between the ASIC-S container and the generation of the
evidences. 

____

Note: The evidence is generated by the connector but the generation of some evidences must be triggered
by the business application. For further information check link:../evidence.html[this] out.
