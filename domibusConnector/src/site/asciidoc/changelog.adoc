== 4.0.x

=== 4.0.1
Bugfix: Reading and respecting of property "connector.backend.ws.trust.store.path" to correctly address the backend's truststore.

== 4.0.2

Bugfix: The truststore for the security library to verify documents signatures and received ASIC-S containers initializes default values that load an invalid truststore if properties "connector.security.truststore.path" and "connector.security.truststore.password" are not set properly.
Bugfix: When submission to the gateway fails no further message processing is executed and no stacktrace is logged. A "RELAY_REMMD_REJECTION" should be produced and sent back to the backend.
Bugfix: Example property "gateway.endpoint.address" should document that this is used for the creation of the evidences. So the external known address of the gateway should be entered.
Bugfix: Property "connector.gatewaylink.ws.submissionEndpointAddress" is used for transmission to the gateway. This is not documented in the example properties.
The property "gateway.name" is only used for evidence generation. Therefore it's place and documentation within the example properties changed.
The property "gateway.role" is not used within the domibusConnector. Therefore it is deleted from the example properties.
