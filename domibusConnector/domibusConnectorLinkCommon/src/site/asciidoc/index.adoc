=== Configuration

The Links are known to the connectorController only by
DomibusConnectorLinkPartner. Only the LinkPartner name is stored
to the message processing. So how/who the LinkPartner is is completly
transparent to the message processing flow.

The configuration itself is read into the DomibusConnectorLink and
DomibusConnectorLinkPartner classes. Afterwards when the LinkPartner and Link is
activated during startup the ActiveLinkConfiguration and ActiveLInkPartner
is created.
