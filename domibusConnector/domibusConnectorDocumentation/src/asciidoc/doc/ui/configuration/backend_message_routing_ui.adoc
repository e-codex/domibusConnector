= Backend Message Routing View

This view allows configuring how and which messages are routed to which of the available destinations ("backends").

== Backend Routing Table

Every row in the table shows a routing configuration.

The "Configuration Source" can have values (IMPL, ENV or DB), which describes where the rule configuration originates from.

The "Priority" column states which rule

|===
|Value |Description

|IMP
|This rule was configured automatically as a default for e.g. connector-to-connector tests.

|ENV
|The rule is in the configuration file.

|DB
|The rule is in the database.

|===

The "Link Name" column contains the name of the backend to which a message is routed if is matched by the clause.

The "Match Clause" column contains the rule by which messages are selected for routing. Only matching messages are routed.

The "Priority" column contains an integer value. Higher numbers take precedence over lower numbers e.g. 0 is of higher priority than -2000. If there would be more than one match, only the match of higher priority is executed and the message is only forwarded to that backend.
