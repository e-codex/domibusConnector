== ECodex Container Configuration

The eCodexContainer is build by the connector. The build container will also be signed by the connector.

Any received eCodexContainer is verified by the connector. The used certificates, private keys and settings are here.

.ECodex Container Signature Validation Config Properties
|===
| property | description

| Location of EtsiValidationPolicyXml
| The location of EtsiValidationPolicyXml. This policy describes which encryption and signature algorithms and formats are valid for the ASIC-S container.

| Use Trust Store
| Use the configured Trust Store as trust source

| Trust Store Configuration
| The Trust Store Configuration. A KeyStore configuration with location, password and key store type. Usually this configuration is changed by uploading a connector trust store via the p-Mode upload. This TrustStore holds all trusted cerficates from the associated e-Codex communication partners.

| Use Ignore Store
| Should the ingore Store be used. Any certificate in here would be consideder as not trusted!

| Ignore Store configuration
| A KeyStore configuration with location, password and key store type.

| Set the trusted list source
| The trusted list source. This should remain empty in most of the e-Codex use cases because trust is established via the distributed keystore which holds the certificates for all trusted communication partners.

| Should OCSP be used on certificate verification
| Should OCSP be used on certificate verification. For this the checked certificate must provide a OCSP source address and the connector itself must be able to reach the OCSP source.

| Should CRL be used on certificate verification
| Should CRL be used on certificate verification. For this the checked certificate must provide a CRL URL and the connector itself must be able to reach the provided CRL URL.

.ECodex Container Signature Configuration Properties
|===
| property | description

| Encryption Algorithm
| Which Encryption Algorithm should be used for signatures

| Digest Algorithm
| Which Digest Algorithm should be used for digests during signature creation.

| Key Store Configuration
| A KeyStore configuration with location, password and key store type.

| Private Key Configuration
| Private key configuration with key alias (must exist within the keystore) and a key password to open the private key. This key is used to sign the ASIC-S container, TrustTokenPDF, TrustTokenXML. The public key of this keypair must be shared with your communication partners.
